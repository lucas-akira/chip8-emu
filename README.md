CHIP-8 emulator written in C, using OpenGL.

## Brief description

From Wikipedia: CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language developed by Joseph Weisbecker, initially used in the mid 1970s to allow easier programming of games. There are a number of classic video games ported to CHIP-8 such as Pong, Space Invaders and Tetris.

It is considered one of the easiest emulation projects to undertake, given its simplicity.

## Current state

Right now the emulator can boot some ROMs successfully, but there is no input support yet.
